description.threshold=If the total number of errors exceeds this threshold then a build is \
           			  considered as unstable. Leave this field empty if the unstable state of the build \
           			  should not depend on the total number of errors.
description.newThreshold=If the number of new errors exceeds this threshold then a build is \
           			  considered as unstable. Leave this field empty if the unstable state of the build \
           			  should not depend on the number of new errors.
description.failureThreshold=If the total number of errors exceeds this threshold then a build is \
           			  considered as failed. Leave this field empty if the failed state of the build \
           			  should not depend on the total number of errors.
description.newFailureThreshold=If the number of new errors exceeds this threshold then a build is \
           			  considered as failed. Leave this field empty if the failed state of the build \
           			  should not depend on the number of new errors.
description.healthy=Report health as 100% when the number of errors is less than this value.
description.unhealthy=Report health as 0% when the number of errors is greater than this value.
